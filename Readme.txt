THe API testing part is done using postman and the public link for that is attached in the text file 
named "Public Link for API testing.txt"

The UI testing part is done using Selenium and TestNg and the code for the same is committed in the repository

The test scenario document is also attached in the same repo.

I was able to complete only this much with the given time.
